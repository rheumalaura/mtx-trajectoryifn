# mtx-trajectoryifn

The project aimed at combining the IFN score designed by Melissa Kartawinata (MK) et al and the machine learning based trajectory analysis performed by Stephanie Shoop Worrall et al (SSW).

The CHARMS cohort was sent on 04/04/2025 by SSW by Zendto (secure). This dataset was merged with the CLUSTER drug cohort described in MK’s paper. The interferon scores were not generated anew but sent to Laura by Wei-Yu Lin on 25th March 2025 and attached to the clinical information by ID. The trajectory imputation was performed by LS with the supervision and support of SSW in July 2017 using Stata 17 (Temporary license). Subsequent analyses were conducted in R and supported by Chris Wallace.
